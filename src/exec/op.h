// op.h — one in-flight command. This is the execution context, and it is the ring slot of the ROB.
//
// GENERALITY BEYOND STRINGS comes from the reply representation, not from a type hierarchy: the
// worker writes RESP bytes straight into the Op's own buffer. The one exception is the explicit
// borrowed-byte descriptor used by large GETs; it describes lifetime and routing, not a value type.
// A command that returns a hash, a range, or a nested array still uses the same byte sink.
//
// LIFETIME, which is the subtle part. argv entries are Slices INTO the connection's read buffer —
// that is what makes parsing zero-copy. So the read buffer must stay pinned until this Op retires.
// The ROB gives that for free: the buffer is pinned until flush_id passes the last Op referencing
// it. Getting this wrong is the same shape as the fork's worker-argv refcount race, where a worker
// touched argv after the owning thread had recycled it.
//
// OWNERSHIP HANDOFF. Exactly one field crosses threads: `state`. The IO thread publishes an Op with
// a release store of Issued; the worker consumes it, fills `reply`, and publishes Done with a
// release store; the IO thread observes Done with an acquire load and only then reads `reply`.
// Everything else is touched by one thread at a time, ordered by that single pair.
