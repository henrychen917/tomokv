// command.h — the command table.
//
// A command is data, not a class. The dispatch path does one lookup and one indirect call; adding a
// type later means adding rows, not changing the machinery. Handlers write RESP straight into
// op.reply, so nothing here knows what a value is.
//
// KEY POSITION IS METADATA, not a parse-time discovery. The IO thread must know which arguments are
// keys BEFORE it can route, because routing happens before execution. v1 covers only single-key
// commands (first_key == 1); the multi-key forms need the key range so a command can be split
// across shards and reassembled, which is why the fields exist now rather than being added later.
