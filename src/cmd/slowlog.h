// ZERO COST WHEN OFF IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. With slowlog-log-slower-than = -1 and
// latency-monitor-threshold = 0 the executor pays exactly one predicted-false branch PER BATCH --
// not per op -- and reads no clock at all. Everything below that gate is out of line.
//
// WHEN ARMED the executor times at BATCH granularity (two clock reads per <=32 ops) and escalates
// to per-op timing only after a batch overruns. See NOTES-SERVERTAIL.md for the attribution
// semantics, which differ from redis's and are documented rather than papered over.
