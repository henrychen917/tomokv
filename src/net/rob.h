// rob.h — the reorder buffer. One per connection.
//
// THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES. A pipelined client sends GET a, GET b, GET c on one socket. Those keys can
// live on three different workers, which finish in any order. The protocol requires the replies in
// the order sent. So we need out-of-order execution with in-order retirement — a reorder buffer, and
// the name is not an analogy: dispatch_id is the issue pointer, flush_id is the commit pointer, and
// a slot retires only when every older slot has retired.
//
//   dispatch_id  next id to issue     — advanced at parse
//   flush_id     next id to retire    — advanced at retire (both by the connection's io thread)
//   slot(id)     id & mask
//   in_flight    dispatch_id - flush_id
//
//   dispatch_id == flush_id is the universal quiescence fence. Nothing is in flight, so the
//   connection can be closed, migrated, or have its buffers recycled. Every teardown path tests
//   exactly this and nothing else.
//
// ============================================================================================
// WHAT CROSSES THREADS, in pure 2s: the io thread owns BOTH counters (it parses and it retires).
// The executor only ever touches individual Op slots — reached through chunk pointers published
// with release/acquire, contents ordered by the Op's own state handshake (Issued/Done). The two
// counters stay atomics anyway: on x86 the same-thread case degrades to ordinary loads and stores
// (zero cost), and dispatch_id == flush_id is the quiescence fence a future connection MIGRATION
// between io threads must read from the other side — demoting them buys nothing and closes a door.
//
// READ-BUFFER PINNING STILL FALLS OUT. argv Slices point into the connection's read buffer. Because
// retirement is strictly in order, the oldest live op is always slot(flush_id) — so every byte
// before that op's rbuf_off is dead. No refcounting, no generation numbers.
//
// SLOTS ARE CHUNKED, NOT INLINE AND NOT SCATTERED. An ExecContext is ~328 bytes; held by value a
// 64-slot ROB is ~21KB resident per connection whether it ever pipelines or not. The first pointer
// version fixed that with one heap Op per slot — and measured a −3% SET p32 regression, because 64
// scattered allocations lost the sequential locality the drain used to get from the inline array
// for free. So: contexts materialize in CONTIGUOUS CHUNKS of eight, on the first touch of any slot
// in the chunk. A p1 connection holds one chunk (~2.6KB), a 32-deep pipeliner four, and the drain
// walks sequential memory within every chunk. Each context recycles in place forever ("flushed"
// logically at retire — state goes Free — never returned to the allocator until the connection
// dies); steady-state allocator traffic is zero, and jemalloc needs no pool in front of it.
