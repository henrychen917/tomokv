// epoll.h — the second network event engine, selected at boot by --net-io epoll.
//
// WHY A SECOND ENGINE AT ALL. io_uring is the native path and stays the default: ring per thread +
// DEFER_TASKRUN is where the measured wins live. But io_uring is not always available (older or
// hardened kernels, containers with io_uring_setup seccomp-blocked, some hypervisors) and it is not
// always wanted. This engine exists so the same server binary still runs there, correctly, at
// whatever speed epoll gives.
//
// WHAT AN ENGINE IS ALLOWED TO CHANGE. Only how an io thread WAITS FOR and COMPLETES network
// readiness. Routing, shard ownership, the ROB, retirement order and the reply STRUCTURE are engine
// independent; both engines feed exactly the same parse -> route -> retire -> stage -> write
// pipeline. The choice is resolved ONCE, at boot, into a template parameter (see IoLoop::run), so no
// per-event branch on "which engine" exists in either instantiation.
//
// THE THREE SHAPE DIFFERENCES, stated once here because every subtlety below follows from them:
//   1. io_uring COMPLETES operations; epoll only REPORTS READINESS. So under epoll the io thread
//      issues recv/send/accept itself, synchronously, and the "completion" is the syscall's return
//      value fed to the same accounting the CQE result feeds.
//   2. io_uring holds a pointer into our buffers while a recv/send is in flight. epoll never does.
//      That makes the read buffer resettable at every quiescence point rather than only when no
//      recv is armed, and it makes a closing connection releasable immediately.
//   3. epoll has no cross-thread doorbell of its own. io_uring has msg_ring. See uring.h for the
//      eventfd mailbox that stands in for it, so the ex side and every channel wake stay unchanged.
//
// EDGE TRIGGERED, ARMED ONCE PER OWNERSHIP TENURE, NEVER HOT-PATH RE-ARMED. A connection is added
// when an IO thread acquires ownership and normally remains registered until ::close(). Runtime
// migration deliberately extends the old lifetime arm-once contract: at an event-loop boundary the
// destination pre-registers the fd while the old owner registers a duplicated descriptor for the
// same socket, then removes its original entry before the connection-owner edge. Destination and
// backup events are ignored during preparation. Commit closes the backup; rollback makes that
// already-registered duplicate the Client's fd and closes the original. Thus every ADD/dup is a
// reversible preflight operation, never a post-commit or rollback connection-loss point.
// Edge triggering retains the standard obligation: read/write until EAGAIN, and if we stop early
// (no read space, ROB full) remember that ourselves rather than expecting another edge. Client's
// recv_armed_ carries exactly that memory under this engine -- true means "we reached EAGAIN, an
// edge is owed", false means "there may be more, retry without waiting".
