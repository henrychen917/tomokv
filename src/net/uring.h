// uring.h — one io_uring per thread. The native network backend, and the default.
//
// SECOND ENGINE (--net-io epoll, see net/epoll.h). When epoll is selected this class becomes a
// pure CROSS-THREAD DOORBELL and issues no io_uring syscall at all -- not even io_uring_setup. That
// is the whole point of the mode: the server has to boot where io_uring is unavailable.
//
// Why the doorbell lives HERE rather than in a new abstraction. Every cross-thread wake in the tree
// is spelled `my_ring.msg_to(peer_ring, tag)` -- Channel::wake, ThreadCtx::wake_if_parked, the
// snapshot epoch barrier. Those call sites belong to the EX side and to the channel mesh, which the
// engine change is not allowed to touch. So the ENGINE-DEPENDENT PART IS HIDDEN BEHIND THE SAME
// FOUR METHODS instead: in epoll mode msg_to() posts the tag into the target's mailbox and rings its
// eventfd, and for_each_cqe() hands those tags back shaped exactly like CQEs. Both loops' on_cqe
// switches therefore see the identical tag stream in either engine, and ex_loop.h, thread.h and
// signal.h are unmodified.
//
// THE TAG MUST SURVIVE, not just the wake. The snapshot epoch barrier posts UrKind::SnapshotStart
// carrying a SnapshotManager*, and the executor that receives it calls begin_snapshot() on that
// pointer. A doorbell that only said "wake up" would silently break BGSAVE under epoll -- the
// executors would never enter the barrier and the snapshot would hang. Hence a mailbox of tags, not
// a bare eventfd counter.
//
// Cost when NOT selected: one predicted-not-taken test on wake_fd_ per outer-loop step (submit,
// wait, drain) and per park-wake. Nothing per operation, nothing per event.
//
// RING PER THREAD, NEVER SHARED. A shared ring needs locking around the submission queue and
// serialises every thread through one completion path. Per-thread rings with SINGLE_ISSUER let the
// kernel skip its own internal locking, and it is the configuration where io_uring actually wins:
// naively swapped in, io_uring is roughly net-neutral, and the large gains come from exploiting it
// deliberately (ring per thread + DEFER_TASKRUN).
//
// DEFER_TASKRUN is on, with one consequence recorded here because it already caused a wrong reading
// once: it defers completion processing to the point where the thread waits on the ring, which means
// the thread's CPU time no longer reflects how busy it is. Any controller that reads thread busyness
// to make decisions will be BLIND under this flag and must sample CPUTIME explicitly instead of
// inferring it from loop behaviour.
//
// USER DATA encodes what a completion was for. x86-64 user pointers are canonical 48-bit, so the
// top 16 bits carry the kind — same trick as the FlatStore slot.
