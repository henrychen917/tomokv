// conn.h — Client: one connection, one struct, one owner.
//
// UNIFIED (owner order, 2026-08-24, after the pure-2s ruling). The ConnIn/ConnOut split — with an
// alignas(64) firewall between the halves — existed so the parsing thread (ifid) and a remote
// sending thread (wb/exwb) could not false-share. In pure 2s ONE io thread owns both halves at a
// time; a migration changes that owner only after the connection is quiescent. Thus the split
// bought padding and a pointer hop for a hazard that no longer exists. The layout rule inverts:
// pack the io thread's recv+send scalars TIGHT (they are touched together every pass), and give the
// fields the EXECUTOR reads per completion — the two atomics it signals through, plus ifid_thread_
// and id_ — their own line at the tail, which nothing writes per op.
//
// What ex touches, and nothing else: ROB slots (Op state/reply/direct region — Rob manages its own
// cross-thread layout), the bytes of rbuf via argv Slices (heap data, not this struct), the direct-
// reply region inside buf_[] (data bytes, published by the op's Done), and the executor-facing
// tail line (retire_queued_, wb_slot_, ifid_thread_, id_ — read per completion, written only at
// accept/migration/close). Every scalar above it is single-writer io state; io's per-op counters
// (obuf_bytes_, atomic_groups_io_) live on io-private lines so no completion ever misses on them.
//
// ============================================================================================
// THE READ BUFFER MUST NEVER MOVE LIVE BYTES. This is the subtle one.
//
// argv Slices point INTO the read buffer — that is what makes parsing zero-copy. Compaction, the
// obvious way to reclaim space, memmoves the live region to offset 0. Doing that while ops are in
// flight silently invalidates every Slice a worker is about to read, on another thread. It would
// produce corrupted keys and wrong replies, intermittently, under pipelining only — close to the
// worst bug shape there is.
//
// So the buffer is APPEND-ONLY while anything is in flight, and is reset only at a quiescence
// point, where by definition no Slice into it survives. Growth is bounded by refusing to read more
// when the buffer is large and not draining; the ROB window already caps in-flight ops, so this
// converges rather than deadlocks.
//
// The alternative — copying argv into each Op — costs a memcpy per argument on the hot path, which
// is exactly the allocation/copy volume the design is trying to avoid.

    // ---- OUT-OF-BAND FRAMES ---------------------------------------------------------------
    // Pub/sub deliveries, tracking invalidations and MONITOR feed lines are WHOLE frames produced
    // by something other than this connection's op stream. Two rules govern where they may land,
    // and both were learned the hard way:
    //
    // 1. NEVER INSIDE ANOTHER REPLY'S BYTE RANGE. The predecessor of this routine parked the frame
    //    on the newest live op -- `rob.at(rob.dispatch_id()-1).reply.append(frame)`. `op.reply` is
    //    the frame's TAIL for a copying reply, which is what that trick was designed against, but
    //    it is the frame's HEAD for a BORROWING one: serve emits [direct+reply][borrow][CRLF], and
    //    a borrowed GET puts only `$<len>\r\n` in the sink. So a push landed between a bulk header
    //    and its body and desynchronised the connection by exactly the push length -- silently, on
    //    plaintext and TLS alike. It also raced a worker appending to that same SmallBuf, where
    //    grow() frees the block the other side is writing into.
    //
    // 2. NEVER OVER A LIVE DIRECT-REPLY REGION. `Op::direct` is a raw pointer into fill_buf()'s
    //    SPARE CAPACITY, handed out only when the ROB is idle and the fill buffer is empty. An
    //    append_fill while it is live overwrites the bytes a worker is formatting, can grow (free)
    //    the block underneath it, and leaves retire's commit_fill publishing the wrong offset.
    //
    // Both are satisfied by one test at the point the send engine releases a frame: while younger
    // ops are still in flight, route through the SEGMENT queue, which owns its own block and never
    // touches fill_buf. seal_fill_segment() first, because pump drains the whole segment queue
    // strictly BEFORE it promotes the fill buffer -- so older staged bytes must move into the
    // queue's tail or the frame would jump ahead of them. A quiesced connection with an empty queue
    // (the idle subscriber, which is the hot pub/sub case) keeps the plain fill append unchanged.
    //
    // The op stream and this channel then interleave only at frame boundaries: retire stages each
    // op's bytes in one uninterrupted run, and a frame appended here sits entirely before the next
    // one. WbEngine::defer_oob parks a newly produced frame until every earlier-issued reply has
    // been staged; a parked blocking command is the deliberate latency-bounded exception.
    // Returns TRUE when this append had to take the segment channel. The callers count only direct
