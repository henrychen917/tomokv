// wb.h — write-back: turning completed replies into bytes on a socket.
//
// PURE 2s (owner ruling 2026-08-24): the io thread that owns a connection is its only sender,
// for life. The 3s posture (dedicated wb threads) was measured and deleted -- its one win was
// +2-4% at 64c p32 (deep pipe + ex-scarce, the split tax amortized), and it lost everything
// else: p1 -22..-35%, p32<=32c -8%, overload -8% with double the tail, large values tied at the
// wire wall with worse tail. The depth sweep (p1..p32: -33% -> +4%, crossover ~p16-32) is the
// architecture story: the split's per-op tax (extra kernel transitions, Client/sock line
// migration, one hop) amortizes with batching, and only then can decoupled edges convert saved
// cores into ex. One base is worth more than that corner.
//
// (Executor-issued sends (exwb) existed and were DELETED
// 2026-08-24: #1 in zero measured cells. Send work rides the scarce ex role: nearly free at p1,
// ruinous at p32. The p1 width law explains its old small-size p1 second places, and 2s dominates
// those anyway.)
//
// The width law (2026-08-24): p1 throughput = min(recv lanes, send lanes) x per-lane rate; a 2s io
// thread is both lanes at once, so 2s buys width ~twice as cheaply and owns p1. 3s protects ex from
// send work and wins high-core high-pipe (64c p32) and overload.
//
// ============================================================================================
// THE LOCK BUG THIS FILE EXISTS TO PREVENT
//
// In the fork, lock and unlock each independently re-derived the write-back object from the client:
//
//     tomoWbLockClient(c)   { wc = clientTail(c)->wb; ...lock(wc); }
//     tomoWbUnlockClient(c) { wc = clientTail(c)->wb; unlock(wc); assert(before > 0); }
//
// If that expression yielded a different object between the two calls, unlock released a mutex it
// never held and decremented a counter lock never incremented. It crashed on the 25GbE NIC and was
// NOT reproducible on loopback — the worst possible shape.
//
// WbGuard resolves the target ONCE, in its constructor, and uses that captured pointer in its
// destructor. Re-derivation is impossible, so the entire bug class is gone by construction rather
// than by discipline.
// ============================================================================================
//
// TWO ENGINES, ONE REPLY STRUCTURE (--net-io, 2026-08-28). Under io_uring a send is SUBMITTED and
// its result arrives later as a CQE; under epoll the io thread issues the syscall itself and the
// result is in hand immediately. Everything else -- what gets staged, in what order, which borrow
// is released when, the one-send-per-socket rule -- is identical, and deliberately so: the reply
// path's shape is not the engine's business.
//
// The split is a TEMPLATE PARAMETER, not a field. serve/pump/submit take <bool kEp> and the io loop
// passes the value its own boot-resolved instantiation carries, so the uring build emits exactly the
// instruction sequence it emitted before this lane and the epoll build never tests a mode bit. The
// two cold entry points that cannot be templated (serve_suppressing, reached only from the CLIENT
// REPLY object; the TLS drain inside close_client) dispatch on epoll_ instead -- both are already
// out-of-line and neither is on a hot path.
//
// WHY EPOLL DOES NOT REUSE on_send_complete. That handler ends in "resubmit -> pump", which under
// io_uring means "queue another SQE and return". Called synchronously it would mean "syscall again,
// right now, from inside the accounting for the previous syscall" -- and on EAGAIN, which is the
// normal steady state of a backed-up socket, it would recurse until the stack ran out. The epoll
// pump is therefore an explicit loop with EAGAIN as its exit, and it stops leaving the connection
// staged; the EPOLLOUT edge (armed once at accept, never re-armed) is what resumes it.
