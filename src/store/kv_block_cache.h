// kv_block_cache.h — the fused owner's post-grace KvObj block cache.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. While read-local is armed a published object is immutable: readers hold no lock,
// so a write may never overwrite one in place. Every armed write therefore builds a FRESH object,
// publishes it, and retires the displaced one through QSBR — one mallocx and one sdallocx per
// write that the unarmed in-place path does not pay at all.
//
// WHY REUSE IS SAFE. Once the QSBR grace floor has passed a retired object's stamp, no reader can
// still hold a pointer to it, and by the single-owner law no thread but its shard's owner may
// touch it. That is exactly the licence the code already used to call free() at that point. This
// cache is fed at precisely that call site and drained only by the same owner thread, so:
//   * single-owner writes are preserved — the cache is owner-private, never shared, never locked;
//   * readers are never obstructed — nothing is recycled before the grace floor has released it;
//   * immutable replacement is preserved — a reused block becomes a DIFFERENT object than any
//     reader can be holding, because the block only returns here after every such reader is gone.
// Recycling reuses provably unreachable memory. It does not shorten any object's lifetime.
//
// WHY PER OWNER AND NOT PER SHARD. Measured, not assumed. A per-shard variant of this cache was
// built first and lost 2-4% of armed SET throughput at 8 and 64 shards while winning at 1 shard:
// its head array and byte gauge are two extra cache lines PER SHARD on a path whose allocator
// alternative (jemalloc's tcache) is per-THREAD and always hot. One cache per fused owner restores
// that property — a single head array, hot in L1 for every write regardless of which shard the key
// lands on — and a shard ownership handoff simply changes which owner's cache serves it next,
// without any cache ever becoming cross-thread.
