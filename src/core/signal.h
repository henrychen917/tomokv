// signal.h — ONE cross-thread signalling mechanism, used by all three loops, reporting in ONE set
// of units.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The three handoffs started out as three different mechanisms: IO->EX was a
// bare queue push with no wake, EX->IO was a msg_ring poke plus a scan of every active client, and
// the WB handoff was a queue plus a poke. A flip/LB controller reading those would be comparing
// three incomparable things — a depth, a scan cost, and a wake rate — and would have to special-case
// each one. Every balancer defect in the fork came from comparing mismatched quantities.
//
// So: every cross-thread handoff is a Channel, and every loop reports LoopSignals. Same shape, same
// units, whatever the direction.
//
//   IO -> EX    MaskedChannelArray dispatch a parsed Task to the shard's owner
//   EX -> IO    Channel<Client*>   tell the owner it has completed ops to retire
//   IO/EX -> WB Channel<Client*>   tell the sender it has bytes to write
//
// UNITS, fixed here so nothing has to be converted at the point of comparison:
//   work      operations (uint64 monotonic count)
//   time      NANOSECONDS, and busy is TIME-WEIGHTED, not an event count. A balancer that counts
//             events treats one expensive op the same as one cheap one; the fork's working pressure
//             balancer is time-weighted for exactly this reason.
//   pressure  queue depth in ENTRIES, accumulated with a sample count so a consumer can take a
//             time-average rather than a spot reading. Spot depth is noisy enough to make a
//             controller chase its own tail.
//
// THE 3% RULE. This machinery is always on, so it must cost under 3% or it does not ship. Hence:
// counters are plain non-atomic uint64 written only by their owning thread; the only atomic on the
// hot path is the peer-blocked flag, and it is read, not written.

// NotifyMask — the "where should I look" bitmap. One bit per producer.
//
// WITHOUT IT every consumer polls every producer's channel each iteration: at 128 threads that is
// 128 loads to discover that one of them has work. The mask turns that into one load plus a
// find-first-set per non-empty producer, so the cost tracks the number of ACTIVE producers rather
// than the number of possible ones.
//
// THE RMW TRAP, which is the whole reason this is not just a fetch_or: a blind atomic OR per push is
// a read-modify-write on a line shared with every other producer of that consumer. SPSC exists
// precisely to avoid per-push RMWs, so adding one here would give back what the queue design bought.
// Hence the read-first guard below: once a producer's bit is set it stays set until the consumer
// takes it, so a busy producer pays a shared-line READ and no write at all. Reads scale; writes
// serialise.
//
// THE ORDERING THAT MAKES IT CORRECT. The consumer must TAKE (exchange to zero) before draining,
// never after:
//
//      take bits -> drain those channels          correct
//      drain channels -> clear bits               LOSES a push that landed mid-drain
//
// In the wrong order a producer that pushes between the drain and the clear has its bit wiped, and
// its item sits in the queue until something unrelated happens to notify again. Same shape as the
// queued-flag ordering in the WB path.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ReadyMask — per-SENDER "which of my clients has completed work" bits, one bit per wb slot.
//
// THE #19/#20 DESIGN, ported: workers signal reply-readiness by setting an IDEMPOTENT bit in the
// sender's mask instead of posting the Client* through a channel. Three properties fall out, and
// each one retires a bug class this tree has already paid for:
//   - no claim protocol: a bit set twice is one bit, so the CAS-claim dance (and its StoreLoad
//     fence discipline) is not needed on this path;
//   - no pointers in flight: a channel entry can outlive the client (the teardown UAF); a bit
//     cannot -- the sender maps slot -> client through a table IT owns and IT clears;
//   - no stranding: the bit stays set until the sender takes it, and any completion after a take
//     re-sets it, so "both sides walk away" is unrepresentable.
// Same take-then-serve ordering as NotifyMask; same read-first guard so a busy producer pays a
// shared-line read, not an RMW. set() returns true on the empty->flagged transition (that RMW is a
// full fence) -- the caller who gets true owes the park-wake, exactly like the channel protocol.
