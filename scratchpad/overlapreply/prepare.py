"""Prepare O7's measurement handoff offline; never launch a measured executable.

The owner requires an armed stall profile BEFORE a reply-side implementation.
Keep that prerequisite separate from subsequent PRE/POST judging: identical PRE
arms can establish a control, but cannot be relabelled as a POST result. Reuse
the gate's cell parser and workload definitions rather than inventing a driver.
Generated requests, cell lists and measurements are lane artifacts, not source.
