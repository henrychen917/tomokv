# Cross-owner SORT BY/GET notes

## 2026-08-28: static trace and design checkpoint

No part of this lane is already implemented.  The current multi-executor path still refuses every
`*`-bearing BY/GET in `parse_sort_options`, and `sort_run` still calls `sort_lookup`, which reaches a
second `Shard` directly.  That is legal only because admission currently proves one executor owns
all shards.

The existing seams are sufficient without changing the MVCC resolver or atomic record engine:

1. `xshard_prepare` already forces an actually-dereferencing SORT off localfast.  Its phase-one
   group contains only the source key (the STORE destination is deliberately omitted until hop 2).
2. The source owner's task serializes one source `ObjectImage`.  This is the point at which the
   natural-order element list becomes knowable.
3. A SORT-only state object will be carved into the scatter arena.  Its vectors own the decoded
   elements, concrete derived key/field requests, owner-grouped request order, and resolved values.
   No state is added to `Op` or `Client`; the only new `ScatterState` member is a pointer at its cold
   tail.
4. Completion of the source wave expands every `*`-bearing BY and non-`#` GET pattern for every
   source element.  Requests are bucketed by `router().shard_of(hash)` and posted as a second READ
   wave.  Every task reads only the `FlatStore` of the `Shard&` passed to it.
5. `xshard_execute` already installs `PinnedNowMs(state.now_cut_ms)` and a `ReadEpochGuard` from
   `state.snapshot`/`origin_conn_id` for every owner task.  The derived wave will run under those
   same two cuts as the source wave.  Dereferencing SORT must therefore pin a snapshot even when
   the command has STORE and even at atomic mode 0.
6. Once the last derived owner finishes, one executor calls the existing `sort_run` ordering core
   with a resolved-value matrix.  Missing keys, wrong types, and absent hash fields leave the
   corresponding presence bit clear.  `GET #` and globless patterns never create requests.  The
   existing result/presence vectors then feed either the array reply or `sort_encode_store`.
7. STORE continues through the existing phase-two `hop2[0]` plan and `apply_image_selected`, so the
   destination is written only by its ordinary owner task.

`sort_run` will remain the single implementation of ordering, LIMIT, DESC, NULL handling, and GET
row construction.  The direct shard lookup will be removed; the core will consume optional
parallel resolved BY/GET arrays instead.  Non-dereferencing forms pass no resolved matrix.

### Wave/state details

The ordinary `phase` byte remains 1 for both read waves and 2 for STORE apply.  A SORT-only wave enum
in the arena sidecar distinguishes source/gather/resolved.  This avoids changing the generic
two-hop mutation tests.  Before calling `finish_phase1`, derived groups are replaced with the
original explicit-key groups so generic status/error scans never index the dynamic request order.

Bare commands need a derived-wave publisher shaped like `publish_phase2`.  EXEC children do not
post new tasks: all shards are already transaction participants, so the last source owner rebuilds
the child groups, resets `pending`, and returns `PhaseAdvanced`; participant loops discover their
new group on the next child stage.  The same happens once more for STORE apply.

Task dependency/hazard enumeration must recognize the derived-wave key order instead of indexing
the explicit argv-key array.  This is routing glue only.  The resolver, version selection, commit
publication, and atomic apply machinery are unchanged.

### Snapshot cut inside EXEC

The parent transaction already pins one `SnapshotCut` when it contains a multi-owner read and stamps
read-only xshard children from it before dispatch.  Dereferencing SORT must opt into that same path
even with STORE: its read participant set is dynamic and may span owners although its initial source
group has size one.  The child must borrow the parent's registered cut; it must not register its
private scatter pool independently.

### Required validation geometry (not run in this lane)

This lane must never be validated with one executor.  The gate geometry is exactly:

```
--shards 16 --ratio 6:2 --enable-debug-command yes
```

The SORT battery will fail unless INFO reports 6 I/O and 2 executor threads and a wide `DEBUG SHARD`
candidate walk observes exactly shards 0 through 15. Because the default placement assigns shard
`sid` to executor slot `sid % 2`, it walks candidate pattern prefixes, queries `DEBUG SHARD` for the
source and every concrete derived key, and requires at least one derived key whose shard maps to the
other executor slot. It prints the source/derived shard pair and fails loudly if none is found.
STORE destinations are selected by the same geometry search rather than assumed from a key spelling.

Per lane rules, I have not built anything, run any test/load script, or started a server.

## 2026-08-28: implementation checkpoint

Implemented the planned owner-only waves:

- `sort_run` no longer includes or reaches `Server`, `Shard`, `FlatStore`, or `KvObj`. It consumes
  optional parallel resolved BY/GET arrays, so it remains the only ordering/LIMIT/projection core.
- A `SortDerefState` object is carved after the ordinary scatter arrays. The only new
  `ScatterState` member is its pointer at the cold tail. Concrete keys, fields, values, presence
  bits, and dynamic key order live in that arena-owned object's vectors.
- Source completion decodes the natural elements, expands concrete requests, and rebuilds the dense
  shard groups. Each gather task promotes/resolves only keys in its own `Shard&`, under the existing
  `ReadEpochGuard(state.snapshot, origin_conn_id)` and `PinnedNowMs(state.now_cut_ms)`.
- The last gather task reduces into `ResultHeap`, restores the explicit source groups before generic
  error/status scanning, and either finishes the reply or enters the unchanged STORE hop.
- Bare SORT has a derived-wave publisher. EXEC uses the already-declared all-shard participant
  barrier and advances the child stage twice (source to gather, then gather to STORE when present).
- Dynamic request keys were added to task hazard/dependency enumeration; no generic explicit-key
  index is used during the gather wave.
- Dereferencing SORT now pins a snapshot even for STORE and atomic mode 0. In EXEC it causes the
  parent transaction to register a cut and borrows that exact cut, including for STORE children.
  No resolver/version/publication code was changed.
- The multi-executor option refusals, `sort_deref_local`, and both denial constants were removed.

## 2026-08-28: validation and cleanup checkpoint

- `tests/sort.py` now rejects any geometry other than 16 observed shards at a 6:2 I/O:executor
  ratio. It buckets candidate names with `DEBUG SHARD`, derives the default owner slot from
  `shard % 2`, and fails loudly unless the source has concrete BY and GET keys plus a STORE
  destination on the other executor. The proven command asserts both its exact result and exact
  derived-lookup/reduction counter deltas.
- `tests/gate.sh` gives SORT its own two-executor boot in both atomic modes. The old one-executor
  negative-control target and refusal assertions were removed; the semantic, RYOW, MULTI/EXEC,
  STORE, and randomized phases now all run under the cross-owner geometry.
- The differential SORT leg independently enforces the same 16-shard, 6:2 geometry. It reconstructs
  source membership while walking its generated stream, expands actual generated BY/GET patterns,
  and fails unless both classes have a concrete key on the executor opposite their source.
- Operator documentation no longer describes BY/GET as placement-dependent. The original
  `NOTES-SORT.md` is explicitly marked historical.

Per lane rules these are static test definitions only: no build, server, test, or load process was
started in this lane.

## 2026-08-28: terminal-path audit

The dynamic gather temporarily reuses `ShardGroup::begin/count`, but those ranges index the SORT
sidecar's dynamic `key_order`, not `ScatterState::key_order` (which is sized only for the explicit
source/destination argv keys). Successful reduction restores the source groups before generic
completion. Static review found that an OOM or queue-full exit could reach `first_error` through
notification finalization before that restore and index the wrong order array. `first_error` now
checks gather `group.error` values but deliberately skips the fixed per-key status scan during that
wave; gather requests have no per-key `status` entries. This covers both bare and EXEC terminal
paths without hiding any gather error.

## 2026-08-28: final static audit

- A tracked-source symbol sweep finds no `sort_deref_local`, `kSortByDenied`,
  `kSortGetDenied`, or `TOMO_SORT_NO_READCTX`. ACL's distinct permission-denial messages remain.
- `src/cmd/t_sort.cc` contains no `Server`, `Shard`, `FlatStore`, `KvObj`, or store access. The only
  keyspace reads in the new wave are through the `Shard&` passed to `xshard_execute`, after routing
  the concrete key with `router().shard_of` and posting its shard to `worker_of_shard`.
- Source and gather both pass through the same `PinnedNowMs(state.now_cut_ms)` and
  `ReadEpochGuard(state.snapshot, state.origin_conn_id)`. Bare dereferencing SORT registers that
  cut even at atomic mode 0 and with STORE; an EXEC child borrows its parent's registered cut and
  transaction-wide time cut.
- STORE reduction restores the fixed source groups and enters the pre-existing phase-two plan;
  `apply_image_selected` still runs only in the destination shard task.
- No file under `src/store/`, including `atomic_mvcc.h` and `flatstore_atomic.inc`, changed. The
  `atomics_glue.inc` edits only teach task hazard/key enumeration about the sidecar's dynamic key
  order; resolver, version selection, publication, and apply machinery are unchanged.
- Neither `Op` nor `Client` was edited. Their existing 336/1984-byte static assertions remain; the
  sole `ScatterState` addition is the `SortDerefState*` at the cold tail, and its object is carved
  and destroyed with the scatter arena.
- `git diff --check` is clean across the complete lane diff.

Per the lane prohibition, this audit is static only. No compilation, make target, server, load
generator, or test script was run.

## 2026-08-28: round-2 residual is the oracle's collation locale

The 93 residual rows are not bad derived values. They are the already-documented `ALPHA` locale
axis, exposed by a logging truncation and by the differential gate failing to enforce its own boot
requirement.

The seed-7 generator establishes the state without any post-run inference:

- Ops 137 through 236 issue exactly one `SET so:a_<m> <word><m>` for every `m` from 0 through 99.
  Nothing later writes or deletes an `so:a_*` key. `rebuild()` mutates only the selected source and
  its `so:w_*`, `so:h_*`, and `so:d_*` companions.
- Choosing `BY so:a_*` sets `alpha = True`, and the generator unconditionally appends `ALPHA`.
  These values are deliberately non-numeric and never enter numeric score conversion.
- The ordinary diff reporter printed only `o[:4]`. Thus evidence such as
  `['SORT', 'so:z1', 'BY', 'so:a_*']` hid `ALPHA`, LIMIT, GET, and STORE options.

Ops 268 and 279 use `so:l0 = [19, 50, 83, 6, 9, 68]`. Their weights are respectively
`delta019`, `char-lie050`, `delta083`, `golf006`, `Bravo009`, and `Echo!068`. C/byte collation is
therefore `[9, 68, 50, 19, 83, 6]`, byte-for-byte the target order at op 279. The oracle returned
`[9, 50, 19, 83, 68, 6]`: `Echo!068` moved from the uppercase byte-order block to its locale word
position. Op 268 is the same two element orders projected through `GET so:h_*->g`.

Op 280 is not a one-element source disagreement. Its full command is:

```
SORT so:z1 BY so:a_* ALPHA LIMIT 2 2
```

At that point `so:z1` has exactly `[13, 95, 43]` in zset score order, with weights
`fox_trot013`, `HOTEL095`, and `delta043`. C/byte collation orders the members `[95, 43, 13]`, so
offset 2 returns the target's sole `13`. The oracle locale puts `HOTEL095` last, so the same LIMIT
returns its sole `95`. No source divergence or reply/argv mismatch is needed; the abbreviated argv
was the entire mystery.

The gather path also matches the former source-owner lookup mechanically: both expand the same
parsed prefix/element/suffix, hash with `FlatStore::hash_key`, route through `router().shard_of`,
accept only strings for the plain form, preserve integer text, and use the same read/time cut. Hash
field lookup likewise retains the old type, field-presence, and field-expiry checks. More directly,
the target's exact C ordering above could not be produced without gathering those exact distinct
`so:a_*` values.

The harness defect was in `tests/differ_gate.sh`: `gen_sort` and `NOTES-SORT.md` required
`LC_ALL=C`, but the shared pinned Redis boot inherited the caller's locale. The gate now starts the
oracle through `env LC_ALL=C`. The sort differ also runs a two-value mixed-case/punctuation
collation preflight on both sides and fails immediately with a precise boot diagnostic instead of
emitting a page of false gather diffs. Finally, SORT/SORT_RO diff diagnostics now print the full
argv rather than four entries.

No server code changed. Per the lane prohibition, this conclusion and the harness edits were
checked statically only: no build, server, test, or load script was run.

## 2026-08-28: round-3 MULTI RYOW phase-publication repair

The all-shard EXEC participation added for dereferencing SORT established the necessary local
program order, but the implementation did not safely publish the dynamic gather phase. A
barrier-only transaction fragment called `group_for()` against the live `ScatterState::groups`
table. The last source fragment concurrently reset that table, rebuilt it with the derived-key
groups, reset `pending`, and only then release-stored the new `MultiCommand::stage`.

That left no happens-before edge around the membership lookup. A fragment could see a new group
while it was only partly built and execute it as the old stage. Missing a derived request has exactly
the observed replies: a missing BY is a NULL/zero weight (one element moves), and a missing GET is a
null projection. Pre-existing values make the owner run promotion/resolution before the lookup,
widening the race; this accounts for the absent-key control being much harder to trigger without
changing the semantic diagnosis.

The repair gives each child stage an immutable 256-shard membership mask:

- Stage zero's mask is captured during EXEC preparation, before any owner task is posted.
- On `PhaseAdvanced`, the last old-stage participant first finishes rebuilding `groups`, captures
  the next mask, then release-stores the next stage number.
- A transaction fragment acquire-loads the stage and consults only that stage's mask. A nonmember
  waits without touching `groups`; a member may enter `xshard_execute`, where `group_for()` is now
  protected by the stage publication and the child `pending` join.

At the instant a gather fragment issues, its shard's transaction task has necessarily walked the
earlier commands in its per-shard list. Thus an earlier MSET candidate for the concrete derived key
is already installed, and `ReadEpochGuard(state.snapshot, state.origin_conn_id)` resolves the pinned
cut plus the transaction's own private overlay. The pinned cut is unchanged. The same mask rule also
closes the equivalent live-group race for generic two-hop children inside EXEC.

Per the lane prohibition this repair was reviewed statically only. It was not built, and no server,
test script, or load generator was run. Validation remains `tests/sort.py` at
`--shards 16 --ratio 6:2` in both atomic modes, with cross-owner geometry proven by `DEBUG SHARD` and
absence treated as a hard failure.
