# Lane t-contarity: XGROUP/XINFO container arity and routing

## Problem and invariants

Redis 7.4.2 advertises both `XGROUP` and `XINFO` with arity `-2`: the bare container is invalid,
but every two-argument form must pass the outer arity gate. TomoKV advertises the same metadata
while enforcing minimums of four and three respectively, which prevents `HELP` and also makes the
unauthenticated minimum-arity probe disagree with the advertised row.

Changing only the minimum is invalid. Both rows truthfully declare their keyed arms at argv[2],
and the ordinary route hashes `first_key` before dispatch. A two-argument `HELP` has no argv[2].
The registry validator therefore correctly rejects a lowered row unless it also uses an existing
special-routing class.

The ordering at `src/core/io_loop.h` is intentionally unchanged: the outer registry arity check
runs before ACL authentication. Consequently bare `XGROUP` remains an arity error, while
`XGROUP x` passes the advertised `-2` bound and reaches the `NOAUTH` gate. Subcommand resolution
and shard selection happen later on authenticated traffic.

## Construction

Use the existing `CursorShard | SubcmdRoute` route taken by `OBJECT` and `MEMORY`. Generalize it
from command-name branches to the generated subcommand metadata:

1. Resolve `argv[0]|argv[1]` through `cmdmeta_generated.inc`.
2. Validate the resolved child's positive/exact or negative/minimum arity from that row.
3. If its generated `first_key` is positive, hash that argument and route to its current shard
   owner. If it has no key (HELP and the other keyless OBJECT/MEMORY arms), pin the ordinary task
   to shard 0.

This makes the route data-driven for all four containers. It also removes the OBJECT/MEMORY
choice from the outer-arity error hook; the hook uses the same metadata resolver. A generated
variadic child that crosses a finite top-level maximum remains a handler-grammar syntax error,
which preserves `MEMORY USAGE`'s existing upper-bound behavior.

`XGROUP` remains `Write`; only its HELP child is keyless. CREATE, SETID, DESTROY,
CREATECONSUMER, and DELCONSUMER all carry generated `first_key = 2`, so none can fall onto the
shard-0 pin. `XINFO` follows the same split: HELP is keyless and STREAM/GROUPS/CONSUMERS route by
argv[2]. The registry continues to publish `-2` through the existing generated command metadata.

The stream handlers keep their option-grammar checks, but their coarse private arity tables are
replaced by the shared generated-data validation. Exact Redis 7.4.2 HELP arrays are emitted before
any key access.

## Validation geometry

No build, server, or test is run in this lane. The main session must validate with at least two
executor threads; the standard gate boot `--shards 16 --ratio 6:2 --enable-debug-command yes`
satisfies that requirement.

The directed battery must not infer ownership from key spelling or shard number. It reads
`DEBUG LBSIGNALS` for the live shard-to-executor map, uses `DEBUG SHARD <candidate>` for every
candidate key, selects a key whose executor differs from shard 0's executor, and aborts if no such
key can be found. Every keyed XGROUP arm is then exercised on that key. This catches the dangerous
failure mode in which all SubcmdRoute arms are pinned to shard 0 along with HELP.

Required checks:

- exact `XGROUP HELP` and `XINFO HELP` arrays;
- bare `XGROUP`, `XGROUP BOGUS`, and representative known-arm arity errors;
- CREATE, SETID, CREATECONSUMER, DELCONSUMER, and DESTROY on the proven cross-owner key;
- `XINFO STREAM <missing-key>` returning `ERR no such key`;
- `COMMAND INFO xgroup` and `COMMAND INFO xinfo` retaining arity `-2`;
- the unauthenticated registry-minimum probe continuing to reach `NOAUTH` for `XGROUP x`.
