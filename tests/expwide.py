"""One expiry cut per logical operation. Usage: tests/expwide.py HOST PORT [MODE]

A key deadline is the one mutation with no command behind it, so it is the one thing a fan-out
cannot pin by taking a commit ticket.  Before this lane, every owner of a cross-shard command
compared deadlines against its OWN executor's per-pass clock, so one operation could observe a key
alive on one owner and elapsed on another -- a keyspace that existed at no instant.  Redis takes a
single time snapshot per command, and a transaction or a script is one command, so every access
inside it reads against that one instant.  This battery pins that behaviour.

MODES
  ``all``            the gate battery (default).  Runs unchanged against the vanilla redis oracle:
                     boot it with ``--save "" --enable-debug-command yes`` and point this at it.
                     Sections needing TomoKV's own DEBUG hooks announce themselves as skipped.
  ``repro-natural``  the statistical, hook-free exposure probe.  Not a gate mode -- it reports a
                     rate rather than a verdict, and it takes minutes.

WHY NO SECTION CAN PASS VACUOUSLY
  Every armed check is bracketed by two controls that must answer the other way: a far-deadline
  control (nothing elapses) and an already-elapsed control (everything has).  A server that
  ignored deadlines entirely would fail the elapsed control; one that treated everything as dead
  would fail the far control.  Sections that widen a window assert the window really opened -- the
  hook's own measured elapsed time in S1, the measured length of the transaction in S2/S3.

    Each trial is one pipelined round trip that arms a shared deadline `horizon_ms` out, then fires
    an eight-owner MGET right at it.  The only widener is ORDINARY PIPELINED LOAD from a second
    connection aimed at one of the eight owners, which is real client traffic, not a hook.

    ARMING GUARD: after reading all sixteen arming replies the client checks its own clock.  A
    reply already read was produced by a command the server had already run, so a clean guard
    proves every PEXPIREAT ran before the deadline and none could take the "deadline already past
    -> delete it now" branch.  Without the guard a partial MGET cannot be told apart from keys that
    were removed at arming time -- an unguarded draft of this probe "reproduced" tearing on the
    vanilla redis oracle, 95 times in 20000, purely from that.

    Arms: armed (load on), ctrl-idle (load off), ctrl-far (load on, deadline an hour out).  A
    non-zero ctrl-far means the load alone explains the tears and the armed number means nothing.
