"""Admission witnesses at the derived production window; no window configuration override.

Arm, release the DEBUG hold, THEN demand completion. Only a clean, fully drained witness miss
can be re-armed. Per-attempt telemetry measures both the window hit and reply rates; four attempts
are a bounded discovery budget, not a claim about an unmeasured false-failure probability.

Reconfiguration additionally pre-admits a cross-owner EXEC with the existing fan-out park. Its
copied ten-second deadline outlives the five-second arming budget, while the owner commit hold
is released BEFORE CONFIG. A faster MSET drain cannot remove that identified old-generation lease.
