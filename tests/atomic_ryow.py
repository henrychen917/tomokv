# passes it on the ASAN tier, where the sanitizer's ~5x slowdown does not slow the pipelined and
# the serial arm by the same factor and inverts the ratio: the full gate measured pipe 21,005/s
# against serial 24,202/s and reddened the row while every correctness check in that same run
# passed, and the same build passed 4 of 4 standalone. A ratio-of-rates claim is a performance
# assertion; it belongs on the release build only. It is NOT sniffed from the environment -- the
# caller says so explicitly, so a battery run by hand behaves like the caller asked, not like
