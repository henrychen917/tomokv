"""Withdrawn-candidate battery: an aborted MSETNX must not reach a later EXEC.
Usage: tests/multirace.py HOST PORT

WHAT THIS PINS DOWN
-------------------
Under --atomic 1 a cross-shard MSETNX is a SINGLE-HOP atomic write: every owner installs its
candidate physically first and only then discovers whether some OTHER owner already holds one of
the keys. When it does, the group sets `aborted`, answers :0 and its installed candidates stay
"forever invisible at epoch zero" -- masked by the pending chain and unwound by atomic_collapse().
MSETNX is therefore the one write kind that publishes a candidate it may still WITHDRAW.

atomic_resolve_internal()'s RYOW overlay is keyed on the CONNECTION, not on the logical unit: an
epoch-zero record whose origin_conn_id matches the reader is `own_private` and wins outright.
That is required -- a transaction must see its own still-private installs -- but it also exposed
the in-flight MSETNX's candidate to any LATER command of the same connection. Ordinary pipelined
commands never reach it (xshard_task_should_defer holds them behind their own undecided
predecessor); a MULTI/EXEC fragment did, because it was dispatched without that hold.

So `prepare_write_key()` cloned the withdrawn value as the transaction's OWN candidate and the
transaction committed it with a real ticket. A `MSETNX` that answered :0 and wrote nothing left
`hello` permanently installed, visible to every connection:

    DEL B v0..v5 ; SET B blocker
    MSETNX v0 hello ... v5 hello B hello      -> :0        (B exists, so nothing may be written)
    MULTI ; INCRBY v0 -2 ; INCRBY v1 -2 ; EXEC
      -> pre-fix: -ERR value is not an integer   (the transaction read the withdrawn "hello")
      -> redis:   :-2 :-2
    MGET v0 v1                                  -> pre-fix: "hello" "hello", from ANY connection

The fix parks the transaction fragment behind an older same-connection unit that has installed on
this owner but has not yet decided, so the EXEC runs against the group's verdict rather than its
guess.

This is a RACE -- the owner of a victim key must install before the owner of the blocker vetoes --
so every case runs many rounds and reports a hit count. Pre-fix rates on this box were roughly
40-80% of rounds for the armed case in the first rounds after a boot.

The COMMIT control is what stops the fix from degenerating into "make the group invisible": the
same shape with no blocker must let the EXEC see the MSETNX's value, i.e. read-your-own-writes
across two units of one connection still holds.

Non-vacuity: `atomic_exec_order_holds` counts a transaction meeting an undecided same-connection
unit on an owner -- exactly this window. Under atomic 1 the armed cases must advance it, or the
run never entered the window and its pass proves nothing. Under atomic 0 MSETNX is two-hop and
decides before it installs, so the window cannot open and the counter must read exactly zero;
that arm asserts zero rather than merely tolerating it.

Correctness of the fix's PLACEMENT is a second, separate claim with its own counter.
`atomic_exec_order_late` counts the same question re-asked at install time, and must read zero in
both modes: the park is only safe at dispatch because nothing can appear on this owner between the
dispatch check and the installs. The two counters are deliberately NOT summed -- `holds` is
non-zero by design in exactly the runs that matter, so a shared counter could never be checked
against zero and a violation would hide inside it.

BOTH MODES RUN FROM ONE BOOT, driven by this battery through CONFIG SET (restored at exit). The
armed debug-surface boot it joins is shared with scriptatomic/execatomic/execiso/execfix, each of
which flips `atomic` itself and leaves it flipped, so the boot flag does not decide the mode a
later battery runs under -- measured: the gate's "multirace (atomic 0)" row reported atomic=1.

Boot requirement: --enable-debug-command yes for DEBUG SHARD, so the key set provably spans
distinct owners.
