# One measurement arm for the cross-shard dispatch scaling guard.
#   python3 tests/xshard_dispatch_scale.py <host> <port> [ops] [depth] [rounds]
# Prints:  ARM threads=<n> cross_ns=<f> same_ns=<f> cross_shards=<a>,<b> same_shard=<c>
#
# Two workloads on ONE connection, alternating so drift hits both equally:
#   cross  MGET of two keys that DEBUG SHARD proves live on DIFFERENT shards -> scatter dispatch
#   same   MGET of two keys on the SAME shard -> localfast, never enters the dispatch arm
# `same` is the control: it is the identical command with the identical key count and reply, so any
# difference between the two arms across thread counts belongs to the dispatch path.
# The geometry is ASSERTED, not assumed: a run whose "cross" pair happened to land on one shard
# would measure the localfast path twice and report a meaningless ratio, so it exits non-zero.
