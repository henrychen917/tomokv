"""ARMED-WRITE BLOCK CACHE churn stressor (src/store/kv_block_cache.h).

Usage: rlcache_churn.py HOST PORT [SECONDS] [WORKERS]
  boot: --thread-mode fused --read-local 1 --atomic 1 --enable-debug-command yes

WHAT THIS DRIVES, AND WHY THE DIFFERENTIAL MATRIX DOES NOT. While read-local is armed a published
object is immutable, so every write BUILDS a fresh object, publishes it, and retires the displaced
one through QSBR; after the grace floor passes, the block is offered to the fused owner's private
block cache and the next write of the same size class TAKES it back. The differential matrix
compares replies -- it walks broad command surface at modest depth and rarely rewrites one key
enough times to cycle a block through put -> grace -> take more than a handful of times.

This battery does the opposite: a small key space, rewritten continuously at sizes chosen so the
displaced block is exactly the class the next write asks for, from many connections at once, with
the reads that ARM the lane interleaved on the same connection. That is the tightest possible loop
through the cache, which is where the corruption this reproduces lives:

  * a block that is put() into a class list twice splices a CYCLE into that list;
  * take() then hands the same block out while it is still linked;
  * the caller initialises it as a KvObj, whose header word overwrites the list `next`;
  * the next take() either aborts on the allocation check or dereferences a wild head.

SIZE CLASSES. kv_block_class() is injective over good_size() outputs; below 128 bytes the class is
allocation/16. The value lengths below therefore land in several distinct classes, and each key
keeps ITS size for the whole run so that its own retired block is always the exact class its next
write wants -- a guaranteed take() rather than an allocator call.

THE THREE RETIRE PATHS are all driven, because they use different reclaim callbacks:
  * point writes (SET/INCR)          -> read_local_reclaim_object
  * atomic group writes (MULTI/MSET) -> read_local_reclaim_atomic_object
  * expiry and FLUSH                 -> the same ring, plus release_all() on the whole cache

NON-VACUITY. A run in which the armed lane never served a read, or in which the cache never held a
block, proves nothing about either. Both are asserted from INFO deltas over this battery's own
traffic; a pass is refused otherwise.

# different ones hot, so the balancer moves shards continuously and in both directions, which is

# READ -- the reader holding a pointer into an object the owner is concurrently retiring -- almost
