# RELEASE GATE for tomokv-cpp (split/fused correctness and performance).
#
#   tests/gate.sh         iteration (default): ALL full correctness + the smoke ABBA subset.
#   tests/gate.sh iteration   same default tier; the subset saves only regression cells.
#   tests/gate.sh push    full correctness + ALL regression cells, required for push/release.
#   tests/gate.sh release same as push. `full` is the legacy alias for the same complete gate.
#   tests/gate.sh quick   legacy correctness-only diagnostic: build (release+ASAN), footprint locks, boot
#                         matrix, smoke, torture, RYOW, atomic torn/mixed-write/window gates,
#                         shutdown invariants, counter-fired feature matrix, idle-loop ceiling. Runs on
#                         any machine with at least 16 physical cores.
#   Complete gates add torture-under-ASAN + the Redis 7.4 differential matrix and mandatory ABBA
#                         (the last pushed binary against
#                         the candidate, same session, same box, threshold derived from the
#                         reference's own spread; a missing reference SKIPS LOUDLY and stays red)
#                         + NIC regression cells vs tests/gate_refs.txt (the NIC cells need the 25GbE
#                         netns rig and its scratchpad CLI binary).
#
#   Resource options (CPU lists accept ranges and commas):
#     --server-cores LIST  --server-smt LIST  --load-cores LIST  --load-smt LIST
#     --ports FIRST-LAST  --reference-binary PATH  --candidate-binary PATH
#   Omitted physical ranges use the available topology (at most 128 physical cores). Server SMT
#   is enabled only when explicitly supplied. Correctness uses eight physical cores per slot and at
#   least two separate physical load cores: modest protocol traffic is sufficient for these rows.
#   ABBA runs after all correctness children are reaped, keeps at most 32 physical server cores,
#   and gives all remaining selected physical cores plus their available SMT siblings to load.
#   Explicit --load-smt (including an empty string) overrides that automatic ABBA sibling set.
#   A load CPU must never share a physical core with a server CPU. --subset smoke is forbidden
#   for push/release/full; iteration can opt into full, and perf can select either diagnostically.
#   --candidate-binary bypasses only the release build; instrumented source builds still run.
#   Such external binaries remain valid perf/iteration diagnostics but cannot earn a source receipt.
#   Push/release/full also require a source/binary-bound local receipt. GATE_RECEIPT_BASELINE
#   selects a trusted full ledger; GATE_RECEIPT_NULL selects a recent full byte-identical ABBA
#   control. Defaults come only from a previous certified receipt. On first use, every check still
#   runs; missing baseline/null evidence withholds the receipt and makes the final gate nonzero.
#   The owner reviews that completed full ledger before explicitly using it as the next baseline.
#
#   Every feature battery runs on three boots: split (both atomic modes), fused, and fused with the
#   read-local lane ARMED (--read-local 1, the recommended read-heavy production posture; that leg
#   is the only one on which a clean GET/MGET is served by the lane instead of an owner).
#
#   GATE_QUIET_FILE=<path> (opt-in, for a shared box): nothing that starts CPU work -- a battery, a
#   boot, a build, a load generator -- is launched unless that file exists and is older than
#   GATE_QUIET_MINUTES (3). A running battery always finishes; a build is SIGSTOPped; the idle server
#   is SIGSTOPped while waiting; waited time is taken out of the ledger's per-row seconds and logged
#   to $LEDGER.pauses. GATE_LEDGER overrides the ledger path.
#
# The vacuous-validation rule is load-bearing here: every section proves its mechanism FIRED
# (counters, accepts, direct>0), not merely that nothing crashed. A gate that can pass while
# testing nothing is worse than no gate.

# Expected check counts. These are the whole point of the ledger row: a battery that silently
# stops running drops the count and turns the gate red instead of quietly shrinking coverage.
# Bump them DELIBERATELY when rows are added, and say which rows in the commit message.
# 152 -> 172: the s6 oracle battery, concur, execiso and xacct, each under both atomic modes.
# 172 -> 178: snapcut added two cross-shard snapshot-cut rows per persist-io engine, and execfix
# added its battery under both atomic modes.
# 178 -> 184: edgeproto, edgeenc and edgetime batteries joined the feature loop (both modes each).
# 184 -> 189: cross-owner scripts add their battery under both atomic modes plus three control
# boots (off / byte-limit / window), each needing its own knob value and so its own server.
# 189 -> 192: the three efficiency guards, each on its own boot geometry.
# 192 -> 194: the AOF frame-order battery, on persist-io normal under both atomic modes.
# 194 -> 207: arity, blockmulti, cmdgap, multires and xmove were shipped but not invoked; aclsel,
# cmdmeta and expwide joined the feature loop; cmdmeta coverage is a new static row. Each feature
# battery runs under both atomic modes, so one battery is two rows.
# 207 -> 211: contarity exercises XGROUP/XINFO under the feature boot's 16-shard, >=2-executor
# geometry and infofix checks measured INFO telemetry; each runs in both atomic modes.
# 211 -> 213: cross-owner SORT has its required 16-shard, 6:2 geometry under both atomic modes.
# 213 -> 215: pushtear proves out-of-band frames cannot splice borrowed replies and requires the
# segmented/deferred and zero-copy counters to fire, under both atomic modes.
# 215 -> 224: nine rows landed without a history line (two sibling lanes each claimed 207 -> 209
# and the merged history double-counted). The totals were recounted statically at 239/250 in
# AUDIT-TESTS.md; the per-row ledger file ($LEDGER) is what keeps this list honest from here on.
# 224 -> 236: fused mode adds one boot-line assertion plus five directed batteries (s6,
# multi_exec, edgeproto, atomfix, spinprobe) under each of the two atomic modes: 2 * (1 + 5) = 12.
# 236 -> 238: atomic MGET/MSET throughput floor + tripwire arm/disarm round-trip (a 9x armed-by-
# default tax on the atomic chain read once passed this gate with nothing measuring the path).
# 238 -> 239: pipelined same-connection program order (seed-19 divergence; 74% stale pre-fix).
# 239 -> 240: the flip-controller model unit test (tests/flipctl_unit.cc) as a static build row;
# it compiled clean but nothing built or ran it (AUDIT-TESTS F15). Full: 250 -> 251.
# 240 -> 241: atomic_hazards locks the S1 FLUSH read-cut and S2 XREAD touched-key fixes on the
# existing atomic-on, DEBUG-enabled 2s boot. Full: 251 -> 252.
# 241 -> 243: B+ adds the counting-fingerprint representation unit plus the deterministic
# held-group GET/MGET filter battery. Full: 252 -> 254.
# 243 -> 245 quick: each fused boot now proves its schema-1 final report is present, clean, and
# labels itself as fused instead of relying only on the live INFO assertion. Full: 254 -> 256.
# 256 -> 258 full: the CLIENT REPLY OFF/SKIP cross-shard MGET zero-copy rows (both atomic modes).
# 245 -> 246 quick, 258 -> 259 full: the armed local-read lane-admission battery on the B+ boot
# (deferral, never demotion, when connections x window exceed the 1024-entry lane; P128.md).
# 245 -> 313 quick, 258 -> 326 full: the FUSED + read-local ARMED leg. Fused alone never arms the
# local read lane, so no row had ever run a feature battery on the path that serves every clean
# GET/MGET in the recommended read-heavy posture (30 of 32 passed there on first contact; expwide
# S1 and climon2 NO-TOUCH did not). Per atomic mode: one boot-line row (INFO thread_mode:1s AND
# read_local:1), the same 32 feature batteries as the split loop, and one shutdown row (clean
# report, 1s/fused, AND the lane's hit counters moved): 2 * (1 + 32 + 1) = 68 rows, both tiers.
# 313 -> 321 quick, 326 -> 334 full: eviction accounting rows. tests/evict_battery.py had no gate
# row on any boot; its lfu section failed on the armed lane because lane-served reads never touched
# the LFU/LRU metadata (hot keys were evicted FIRST). lfu and the new lruclock section, each on its
# own fresh boot, on the split and the fused+armed boots, both atomic modes: 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 rows.
# Merged: 245 base + 1 lane-admission row + 76 fused+armed and eviction rows = 322 quick;
# 258 base + 1 + 76 = 335 full. The two additions are disjoint: the lane-admission battery is its
# own row on the B+ boot, not a member of the 32-battery feature list the fused+armed loop runs.
# 245 -> 247 quick (258 -> 260 full): multirace joins the armed debug-surface loop under both
# atomic modes. An MSETNX aborted by a key on another owner had already installed its candidate,
# and a MULTI/EXEC the same connection sent behind it read that withdrawn value through the
# store's connection-scoped RYOW overlay and committed a clone of it.
# 260 -> 261 full: a SECOND differential matrix in the armed-fused geometry (--thread-mode fused
# --read-local 1). The canonical row boots split with the read-local lane disarmed, so it cannot
# reach that lane at all; the armed run carries its own non-vacuity check on read_local_hits.
# ARITHMETIC FOR THE MERGE. This lane (t-multirace) contributes +2 quick and +3 full: two
# multirace battery rows (one per atomic mode, quick and full alike) and one full-only armed-fused
# differ row. It branched from 245/258. A sibling lane (t-replycode) contributes +2 FULL-only from
# the same base, i.e. 245/260. Whichever lands second resolves this hunk by ADDING both lanes'
# deltas to the shared base rather than by taking one side: 245+2 / 258+2+3 = 247/263.
# Merged: 322 quick + 2 (multirace: the multi_exec order-late row per atomic mode) = 324;
# 335 full + 3 = 338. Additions are disjoint from the fused+armed and lane-admission rows.
# 258 -> 260 full: reply codes make a blocking timeout's "*-1"/"_" a CODE rather than bytes, so the
# ACL retire-recheck's discard has a second representation to drop; one battery per thread mode.
# Merged: the aclreply battery adds one row per thread mode and both run BEFORE the quick-tier exit,
# so quick is 324 + 2 = 326 and full is 338 + 2 = 340. (Corrected 2026-09-07: the first resolution read
# the branch deltas 245/260 over 245/258 as full-only and left quick at 324, so every quick gate failed
# its own ledger row by exactly 2 while the full tier was right.)
# 340 -> 343 full: the armed-write block cache's ownership laws (DESIGN-P0REPLY.md). A shard that
# changed owner kept its read-local retire sink pointing at the OLD owner's QSBR ring and block
# cache until the destination's own later pass rebound it, so the new owner wrote through another
# thread's unlocked free list. Three rows: the -DTOMO_RL_CACHE_DEBUG build, the churn battery on it
# (which carries its own non-vacuity checks, including that the balancer MOVED shards), and the
# invariant check over that server's log.
# COUNTED BY LINE, NOT BY INFERENCE (which is what produced the 324/326 correction above): the
# quick tier exits at the `[ "$TIER" = quick ]` block, and all three rows are emitted after it, so
# they are full-only. Quick is unchanged at 326; full is 340 + 3 = 343.
# 324 -> 325 quick (340 -> 341 full): the RYOW write-ring unit joins the static rows, carrying the
# arm-on-demand transient cases (t-ringdiet, DESIGN-RINGDIET.md). One row in BOTH tiers, because it
# is server-less and costs under two seconds; the arithmetic is 324+1 / 340+1 and it is disjoint
# from every boot-geometry loop above.
# Merged 2026-09-07: the ring unit is one row in BOTH tiers (server-less, under two seconds), so
# quick is 326 + 1 = 327 and full is 343 + 1 = 344. Counted by line: the ring row is emitted with
# the static rows, far above the quick-tier exit, and the P0 rows stay below it.
# Measured on the 2026-09-10 full run: 418 rows before the quick-tier exit, 467 total. This run
# then removed the 32-row stored-reference loopback tier and added two ABBA rows -- the serverless
# negative control BEFORE the quick exit (quick +1, full +1) and the mandatory headline result
# AFTER it (full +1). 418+1 = 419 quick; 467-32+2 = 437 full.
