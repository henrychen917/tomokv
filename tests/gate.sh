# Expected check counts. These are the whole point of the ledger row: a battery that silently

# Bump them DELIBERATELY when rows are added, and say which rows in the commit message.
# 152 -> 172: the s6 oracle battery, concur, execiso and xacct, each under both atomic modes.
# 172 -> 178: snapcut added two cross-shard snapshot-cut rows per persist-io engine, and execfix
# added its battery under both atomic modes.
# 178 -> 184: edgeproto, edgeenc and edgetime batteries joined the feature loop (both modes each).
# 184 -> 189: cross-owner scripts add their battery under both atomic modes plus three control
# boots (off / byte-limit / window), each needing its own knob value and so its own server.
# 189 -> 192: the three efficiency guards, each on its own boot geometry.
# 192 -> 194: the AOF frame-order battery, on persist-io normal under both atomic modes.
# 194 -> 207: arity, blockmulti, cmdgap, multires and xmove were shipped but not invoked; aclsel,
# cmdmeta and expwide joined the feature loop; cmdmeta coverage is a new static row. Each feature
# battery runs under both atomic modes, so one battery is two rows.
# 207 -> 211: contarity exercises XGROUP/XINFO under the feature boot's 16-shard, >=2-executor
# geometry and infofix checks measured INFO telemetry; each runs in both atomic modes.
# 211 -> 213: cross-owner SORT has its required 16-shard, 6:2 geometry under both atomic modes.
# 213 -> 215: pushtear proves out-of-band frames cannot splice borrowed replies and requires the
# segmented/deferred and zero-copy counters to fire, under both atomic modes.
# 215 -> 224: nine rows landed without a history line (two sibling lanes each claimed 207 -> 209
# and the merged history double-counted). The totals were recounted statically at 239/250 in
# AUDIT-TESTS.md; the per-row ledger file ($LEDGER) is what keeps this list honest from here on.
# 224 -> 236: fused mode adds one boot-line assertion plus five directed batteries (s6,
# multi_exec, edgeproto, atomfix, spinprobe) under each of the two atomic modes: 2 * (1 + 5) = 12.
# 236 -> 238: atomic MGET/MSET throughput floor + tripwire arm/disarm round-trip (a 9x armed-by-
# default tax on the atomic chain read once passed this gate with nothing measuring the path).
# 238 -> 239: pipelined same-connection program order (seed-19 divergence; 74% stale pre-fix).
# 239 -> 240: the flip-controller model unit test (tests/flipctl_unit.cc) as a static build row;
# it compiled clean but nothing built or ran it (AUDIT-TESTS F15). Full: 250 -> 251.
# 240 -> 241: atomic_hazards locks the S1 FLUSH read-cut and S2 XREAD touched-key fixes on the
# existing atomic-on, DEBUG-enabled 2s boot. Full: 251 -> 252.
# 241 -> 243: B+ adds the counting-fingerprint representation unit plus the deterministic
# held-group GET/MGET filter battery. Full: 252 -> 254.
# 243 -> 245 quick: each fused boot now proves its schema-1 final report is present, clean, and
# labels itself as fused instead of relying only on the live INFO assertion. Full: 254 -> 256.
# 256 -> 258 full: the CLIENT REPLY OFF/SKIP cross-shard MGET zero-copy rows (both atomic modes).
# 258 -> 260 full: reply codes make a blocking timeout's "*-1"/"_" a CODE rather than bytes, so the
# ACL retire-recheck's discard has a second representation to drop; one battery per thread mode.
