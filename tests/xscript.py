# THE COUNTEREXAMPLE FROM AMENDMENT 1, AS A DIRECTED TEST.
#
# The refuted assumption was that staging alone leaves a tripwire on an ordinary declared key. It
# does not, so a plain write landing between admission and an owner's gather was invisible: that
# owner read a value that never existed at the advertised cut, while the coordinator's own key had
# already been read from before the write. The reservation sub-wave exists to force that write
# through MVCC.
#
# The park is placed exactly in that interval and the racing write is issued only after the
# coordinator's own gather has provably completed (counter-polled, not slept), so the two declared
# keys are read on opposite sides of the write. Three independent things then have to be true, and
# each of them is zero on `make noreserve`:
#   * the pair the activation observed is a CUT, never one key from before and one from after;
#   * script_write_tickets_forced rose  -- the write was actually forced through MVCC;
#   * script_group_occ_retries rose     -- validation actually detected it.
