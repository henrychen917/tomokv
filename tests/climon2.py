"""Directed CLIENT connection-control + MONITOR battery. Usage: climon2.py HOST PORT

Every check proves its MECHANISM FIRED, not merely that nothing broke:
  * CLIENT REPLY asserts the exact bytes on the wire, including absence.
  * MONITOR asserts the feed line CONTENT (quoting, redaction) and the
    monitor_feed_lines counter moving.
  * CLIENT PAUSE asserts timing in both directions AND the client_pause_holds
    counter moving -- a pause that never held anything proves nothing.
  * CLIENT UNBLOCK asserts the exact reply the blocked client received.
  * CLIENT NO-TOUCH asserts the client_no_touch_ops counter moving for an owner-served read under
    every thread mode, and accounts for every GET on a fused read-local boot as either owner-
    consulted or lane-served (read_local_keyspace_hits) -- never neither.
Negative controls are included for every one of them.
