"""Same-session headline ABBA gate. No historical rate is a performance target.

WHY NOT STORED REFERENCE NUMBERS. A stored rate goes stale the moment the kernel, compiler,
microcode or machine changes; this tree's old tests/gate_refs.txt was pinned to a kernel that no
longer runs, and the gate's own comments then called every verdict provisional. Measuring both arms
in ONE session on ONE box removes drift, thermal state and machine configuration as variables. The
only difference left between the arms is the code.

THE REFERENCE is the caller's --reference-binary, whose digest is recorded and matched against a
last-push manifest pin when available. Without that argument, origin/cpp is resolved to a full
commit id, then matched against /home/user/Projects/bench-bins/MANIFEST.md. A filename containing
"headline" is NOT evidence of identity; two different digests for one commit are ambiguous and skip.
Missing or unbuildable reference => loud SKIP, never a pass: a correctness-only run must not be able
to call itself a clean gate.

ABBA, NOT A-THEN-B. Every cell runs reference, candidate, candidate, reference and takes the paired
difference. Non-interleaved A/B has produced wrong verdicts on this box before, and a 20-second
window exposes drift that a 90-second window hides. ABBA cancels a LINEAR trend when the run
midpoints are evenly spaced; it cannot promise cancellation of arbitrary interference, periodic
noise or nonlinear drift, so both arm spreads are always reported and a quiet box still matters.

THE THRESHOLD IS DERIVED, NOT CHOSEN. T for a block IS that block's observed reference spread
(100*|A2-A1|/Abar). There is no 3% default, no fixed noise floor, no multiplier, no historical
calibration, and no candidate-dependent widening. A quiet box therefore produces a STRICTER gate,
which is the correct incentive. Two samples measure an observed span, not a confidence interval:
the gate detects losses larger than that span, and a loss inside it is below the session's own
demonstrated resolution -- say that, do not pretend to more.

THE 2% INSTABILITY BOUNDARY IS A VALIDITY CHECK, NOT A REGRESSION ALLOWANCE. An arm whose spread
exceeds 2% fails the MEASUREMENT. Without this, a wildly noisy reference manufactures a permissive
threshold and waves a real regression through. A failed block is never rerun until it happens to
pass, and the best of several runs is never selected.

SATURATION IS A PRECONDITION, not a nice-to-have: an unsaturated cell has headroom that absorbs a
regression, so it cannot detect one at any repetition count. Pinned load levels run one ABBA block
and must still satisfy the productive-role occupancy floor. Unpinned cells, or --escalate,
search until EACH arm stops gaining AND its productive bottleneck role meets the floor.
Raw legacy all-thread busy is retained but cannot penalize legitimate idle executors.
Depth 1 is exempt and
scored as latency -- it is round-trip bound by Little's law. Process CPU is NOT substituted for busy
percentage: doing so hides exactly the unsaturated case this check exists to catch.

THE VERDICT NAMES THE WORST CELL. It is the conjunction of cell verdicts; no average across GET,
SET, thread modes or cells can hide the one cell that fails. A failed precondition outranks passing
cells. --only is a diagnostic selection and yields PARTIAL with exit 3, never a complete-tier pass.

Exit 0: every cell passed; 1: failure; 3: loud skip or successful partial diagnostic.
Comparison PASS additionally requires a recent matching standing null. Missing/invalid controls
leave successful measurements PARTIAL and untrusted. --collect-null 1 freezes identical arms and
collects its own null verdict without a prior control; its outer PARTIAL/3 cannot gate a push.
--self-test is serverless. All other runs own and reap only their subprocess PIDs.
