#             resets on a read, keeps aging under NO-TOUCH, and re-touched old keys outlive

# On a fused boot with the read-local lane armed (INFO server read_local:1) both sections also
# assert the reads they measure were LANE-served: before the lane learned to touch, a key kept hot
# only by such reads was never counted as accessed and was evicted FIRST -- the policy inverted.
