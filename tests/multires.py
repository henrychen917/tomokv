"""EXEC-vs-cross-shard-group commit-order battery. Usage: tests/multires.py HOST PORT

WHAT THIS PINS DOWN
-------------------
A cross-shard atomic write group (MSET/MSETNX/DEL/UNLINK) draws its commit ticket only once its
LAST fragment has installed. A MULTI/EXEC transaction the same connection sends AFTERWARDS can
therefore reach the ticket counter FIRST, so the two units of one connection end up with commit
tickets in the opposite order to the order the client sent them.

atomic_collapse() resolves an overlapping prefix by committed-ticket argmax. Ranking a
same-connection pair by raw ticket made the OLDER group the winner, and its value was then
spliced back into the physical slot on top of the transaction's -- destroying a write EXEC had
already ACKNOWLEDGED, and answering later reads from the group's generation. Program order, not
ticket order, is the truth within one connection: a connection's owner tasks are posted to a
shard in arrival order and drained in order, so the collapse list order already IS that
connection's program order for the key.

The two symptoms this battery separates, both starting from one acknowledged write:
  1. LOST WRITE   -- EXEC answered "the key now holds X" and the settled value is not X.
  2. STALE READ   -- reads issued after that EXEC answer from the group's generation instead.

Both are RACES, so every case runs many rounds and reports a hit count rather than a yes/no; the
pre-fix rates on this box were roughly 22% of rounds for (1) and 37% for (2). A single clean
round means nothing, which is why nothing here concludes from one.

Every case also proves its mechanism FIRED: `atomic_exec_order_holds` counts a transaction
meeting an older same-connection unit that is still undecided on that owner, which is exactly the
hazard window. It is raised at ONE site -- ExLoop::execute(), where the transaction fragment is
parked behind that unit before it installs anything on the owner. A run in which it never advances
never entered the window, and is reported as vacuous rather than as a pass. Negative controls (no
group; a single-key non-group predecessor; the transaction on a second connection) must record no
loss AND are expected to leave the counter alone.

The window this file describes is now closed at DISPATCH rather than at install (NOTES-MULTIRACE.md
§5), so the install-time arm that once raised this counter is gone from it: it reports through
`atomic_exec_order_late` instead, which must read zero. This run asserts that too -- if the park
ever fired too late, these cases are exactly the shape that would show it.

Boot requirement: --enable-debug-command yes for DEBUG SHARD, so the key set provably spans
distinct owners. Runs under both --atomic 0 and --atomic 1; with atomics off there is no group
to invert against, so the window never opens and the counter legitimately stays at 0.
