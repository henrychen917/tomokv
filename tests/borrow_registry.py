# Zero-copy borrow registry scaling battery.
#   python3 tests/borrow_registry.py <host> <port>
# Boot: --shards 1 --zc-min 64 --client-output-buffer-limit normal 0 0 0 --enable-debug-command yes
#   one shard  -> every borrow lands in ONE registry, which is the quantity under test
#   zc-min 64  -> a small value still takes the borrow path, so the probe pays registry cost and
#                 almost no wire cost
#   no obuf limit -> the holders below are deliberately slow readers and must not be disconnected
#
# GUARDS a defect that was REPRODUCED on a live server (see NOTES-XPERF2.md): the registry was a
# linear vector scanned once per borrow, per release, per retirement and per in-place-overwrite
# check, so a borrowed GET cost 2903 -> 3185 ns/op (+9.7%) as the live borrow count on its shard
# went 0 -> ~1100, while the identical NON-borrowed GET stayed flat.
#
# Non-vacuous by construction:
#   - the borrow path is PROVEN live, not assumed: DEBUG BORROWCOUNT reads the exact owner-side
#     FlatStore counters and the battery requires zero without holders, non-zero while parked, and
#     zero again after holder teardown;
#   - the plain-GET arm is a NEGATIVE CONTROL measured in the same loop on the same connection. It
#     never enters the registry, so it is what "no growth" reads like on this machine;
#   - the assertion is a RATIO of two per-op costs measured seconds apart, never an absolute time.
#
# Drift (AUDIT-TESTS F7). The two arms are INTERLEAVED per round (borrow, plain, borrow, plain ...)
# so a CPU-state shift lands on both, not on whichever arm happened to be measured second (the
# observed 567 -> 884 ns "control" flake was exactly that: a shift between the borrow rounds and
# the plain rounds of one sequential measure()). The plain arm is the environment instrument: if
# it still moved, the busy pair is re-rolled (holders stay parked, BORROWCOUNT re-checked) and,
# failing that, a POST baseline (holders released) is measured -- when the plain arm agrees with
# the post baseline the box shifted between the baselines and the post one is the honest
# reference. Every assertion below is unchanged; only the reference it is scored against can move,
# and the row says which one it used.
